In this world, where the game is played with loaded dice, a man must have a
temper of iron, with armor proof to the blows of fate, and weapons to make
his way against men. [...] As long as the issue of any matter fraught with
peril is still in doubt, and there is yet some possibility left that all
may come right, no one should ever tremble or think of anything but
resistance, just as a man should not despair of the weather if he can see a
bit of blue sky anywhere. Let our attitude be such that we should not quake
even if the world fell in ruins about us. [...] Our whole life itself, let
alone its blessings, would not be worth such a cowardly trembling and
shrinking of the heart. Therefore, let us face life courageously and show a
firm front to every ill.

~ Arthur Schopenhauer
